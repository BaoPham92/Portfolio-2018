# Bao's Portfolio

**ReadMe Recap:**

There is already a portfolio built and this is going to be rebuilt upon the original design but with responsive design in mind.


## Objective:

This is going to be the official repository for my portfolio. This repository will be maintained and updated until activity updated on project's activity on this ReadMe file.

## TODO's:

There are to do comments that will be in class named divs. So far as I am building a functional responsive design, I will then use these containers in the future for more effects.
