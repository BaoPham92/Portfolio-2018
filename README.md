# About & Progress

Initially treated as a timed challenge, this was the first pure HTML, CSS & Javascript portfolio developed with responsive design in mind. With the purpose of being able to host my past projects to display understanding on certain development aspects, I developed this after picking up some fundamentals as a timed project testing myself.

The Plan
---

This repo will serve as the stepping stone for designing my next and intuitive outlook in a design aspect. I will most likely keep the all my next portfolio projects in the standard vanilla HTML, CSS & Javascript for showcasing my skillsets.

But also creating a portfolio on a framework is in my opinion a crutch, a short display of what I am capable of, and mindless to an extent. Why need use a framework that has so many dependant packages making performance slower, possibly outdated tech in the future? Conclusions to not capitalize on top of your understanding & foundation of the standard skillsets.

The basics are also a foundation of my skillsets as a developer.

Recent Actvities
---

As of late I been capitalizing on my Javascript skillset by learning full stack development with diverse tech stacks as I want to expand the core capabilities from front end development to back end as well.

Also exploring Javascript with side interests / hobbies such as Blockchain development for decentralization. I know IoT will be a big thing in the future down the road and for sure Blockchain development will have a role to play.

Machine Learning has been less of a explored area and time investments have been prioritized this as a secondary due to strategic move from various impactful events. I still have a strong desire for creating AI software integration with my applications in the future. Always having a spot for Social Engineering growing up from the everday curiousity dazing in and out of my days, AI definitely fits my interests.

Quoted information below presents previous intentions & objectives for the repo.

**Recap:**

> There is already a portfolio built and this is going to be rebuilt upon the original design but with responsive design in mind.

I had a previous much more rugged and rough portfolio. Taking the previous aesthetics in terms of style I made the portfolio functioning this time. This will serve as a great reflection on what I could improve on. The next time iterating more on aesthetically more pleasent style presentation and more iteration on responsive aspect.

This will be updated for a bit until a new portfolio repo is developing.


## Objective:

> This is going to be the official repository for my portfolio. This repository will be maintained and updated until activity updated on project's activity on this ReadMe file.

## TODO's:

> ~~There are to do comments that will be in class named divs. So far as I am building a functional responsive design, I will then use these containers in the future for more effects.~~
